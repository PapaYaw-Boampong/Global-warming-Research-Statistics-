## Overview

The Global Warming Research project is an initiative to analyze climate data and investigate the relationships between land cover change, greenhouse gas concentrations, and annual surface temperature variations. This research aims to contribute valuable insights to the understanding of global warming and its impact on the environment.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Utilize 29 years of climate and land records data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to global warming.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Collaborate with international organizations and experts in climatology and environmental science.
- **Scientific Research:** Contribute to the scientific community by providing data-driven insights into the dynamics of global warming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `data/`: Contains raw and preprocessed climate and land records data.
- `analysis/`: Includes scripts and notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `reports/`: Contains research reports, findings, and documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) installed
- Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- R packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2) for statistical analysis

Feel free to adapt and expand this template based on your project's specifics. Add or modify sections as needed, and provide more details in the statistical analysis script if necessary.

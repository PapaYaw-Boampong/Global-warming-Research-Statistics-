# Global Warming Research

## Overview

The Global Warming Research project is an initiative to analyze climate data and investigate the relationships between land cover change, greenhouse gas concentrations, and annual surface temperature variations. This research aims to contribute valuable insights to the understanding of global warming and its impact on the environment.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Utilize 29 years of climate and land records data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to global warming.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Collaborate with international organizations and experts in climatology and environmental science.
- **Scientific Research:** Contribute to the scientific community by providing data-driven insights into the dynamics of global warming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `data/`: Contains raw and preprocessed climate and land records data.
- `analysis/`: Includes scripts and notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `reports/`: Contains research reports, findings, and documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) installed
- Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- R packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2) for statistical analysis

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/global-warming-research.git
   cd global-warming-research
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install R packages:

R
Copy code
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
Usage
Run data analysis scripts:

bash
Copy code
python analysis/main_script.py
Perform statistical analysis using R scripts:

R
Copy code
Rscript analysis/statistical_analysis.R
This script includes statistical tests like Pearson's correlation coefficient, hypothesis testing, and other relevant measures.

Explore the reports in the reports/ directory for detailed findings.
